# memory-jog
This is a simple game of memory skill that I really had fun creating. 
I needed something to unclog my mind whenever it got tired from debugging codes.
The concept is borrowed from "Simon Game" which was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates.
The game is structured in such a way that it creates a series of tones and lights and requires the user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.
It made using HTML5, some basic CSS, and JQuery.

How to play:
Try to keep up with the pattern from the start.
